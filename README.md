THE IDEA IS THIS: 
- suppose the user doesn't already have a keygaurd/lock screen set on their phone ie the user can access the phone without either a pin or a pattern
- The user loses their phone and is found by someone else
- The user sends an SMS message with a certain phrase (see the left image) to their lost phone
- Based on the phrase, the app locks the phone by showing a lock screen (see the right image). The aim of this is to protect the user's private data.
- The lock screen only allows for a phone call and nothing else
- The lock screen should only be removed when the owner enters a pin number. Otherwise it should be shown at all times

I TRIED TO DO THE ABOVE BUT I SIMPLY COULDN'T.
CURRENTLY THE LOCK SCREEN GETS SHOWEN WHEN AN SMS WITH A CERTAIN PHRASE IS RECEIVED
